# Loan-Prediction-
This project is a Machine Learning model designed to predict the approval status of loan applications based on a variety of input features, such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more. By utilizing classification algorithms, this model helps financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals efficiently and accurately.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data, performed feature engineering, and normalized the data to improve model performance.
Algorithms Used: Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, were implemented and evaluated to select the most accurate model.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used to evaluate model performance, ensuring a robust and reliable prediction system.
User-Friendly: The model outputs whether a loan is likely to be approved or denied, aiding in quicker decision-making for financial institutions.
Goal:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can assist in making data-driven loan approval decisions, reducing manual effort, and improving efficiency in the loan application process.
